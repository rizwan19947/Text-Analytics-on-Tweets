# Text-Analytics-on-Tweets

Sentiment Analysis of user-defined Twitter pages was performed by using NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK and Twython by utilizing a Twitter API through a Twitter developer account 
in order to determine how negative/positive the tweets on a particular Twitter account were. KNIME was used to visualise the results.
